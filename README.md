# Pascal VOC Object Detection using PyTorch

This repository contains code for training and evaluating a deep neural network model for object detection on the Pascal VOC dataset using PyTorch.

## Overview

This project utilizes PyTorch to implement a deep learning model for object detection on the Pascal VOC dataset. It includes scripts for training the model, evaluating its performance, and testing it on a separate test set. The code structure involves separate modules for training, testing, and utilities, aiding in easy management and modification.

## Folder Structure

The project folder structure is organized as follows:


- `models/`: Stores trained model checkpoints and logs.
- `utils/`: Includes utility functions used in training and evaluation.
- `train.py`: Script for training the object detection model.
- `main.py`: Main script to initialize and execute the training and testing process.
- `README.md`: Documentation file explaining the project and its usage.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- tqdm
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Ensure these dependencies are installed in your environment before running the code.

## Usage

To train the model or evaluate its performance, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the Pascal VOC dataset is downloaded and available in the specified directory.
2. Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, epochs, and batch size in the `main.py` file if needed.
3. Execute the `main.py` script by running `python main.py` in the terminal.
4. Check the logs and model checkpoints saved in the `models/` directory for training progress and results.

## Results

After running the training and testing processes, the results will be stored in the `models/` directory. These results include log files detailing training and evaluation metrics, saved model checkpoints, and possibly other generated files based on the settings.
